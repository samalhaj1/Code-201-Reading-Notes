## Structural markup:

● the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs

## Semantic markup:

● which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on


**HTML has six "levels" of headings:**

● <h1> is used for main headings

● <h2> is used for subheadingsIf there are further sections under the subheadings

 ● then the <h3> element is used, and so on...

 ## ***Bold & iTalic***

 ● **<b>** By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.
 
 ● The **<b>** element also represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way (for example key words in a paragraph)

● although the use of the **<b>** element does not imply any additional meaning.


● *<i>* By enclosing words in the tags *<i>* and *</i>* we can make characters appear italic.

● The *<i>* element also represents a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content — such as technical terms, names of ships, foreign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually be italicized.


## line Breaks & HorizonTal :

**<br />**

 As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag **<br />**.

**<hr />**

To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the **<hr />** tag.

There are a few elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. They are known as empty elementsand they are written differently.
