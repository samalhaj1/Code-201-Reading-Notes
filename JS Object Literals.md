# Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming 

## What is the hardest thing about writing code?

Most people who aren’t programmers assume that the job of developing software is hard - and it is, but not in the ways that non-developers would figure.

### 9. Designing a solution

**The task:** Given the requirements of a client, design and architect the technical solution to be implemented. This can include designing data and code structure, functional algorithms and application flow that encapsulate the business logic and satisfy the use cases.

**The challenge:** Making sure you design a solution that meets the client’s requirements, which will make sense to them and which can be built in the required timeframe.

### 8. Writing tests
**The task:** Write unit tests, i.e., programmatic tests of small units of software to ensure that individual functions and routines satisfy predefined criteria. These tests help flesh out bugs early in the development process and can facilitate regression testing later when code is modified or updated. Some development methodologies encourage tests to be written before code is developed, while in other cases they are written after the fact.

**The challenge:** Can be a tedious process to choose tests to write and to code them, which can feel like significant additional work on top of building the application.

### 7. Writing documentation
**The task:** Create documentation explaining what your code is doing or how an application works. It can include stand alone documents and code comments. The intended audience can range from end users to other developers.

**The challenge:** Can be a time consuming task, that can feel like a waste of time if nobody reads it. Programmers usually prefer writing code to documenting it.

**Quotes:**

“Writing useless documents no one will ever read or use, just because it's part of the ‘process’.” [Christian Dechery](https://www.quora.com/Software-Engineering/What-is-the-hardest-thing-you-do-as-a-software-engineer/answer/Christian-Dechery)

“Writing a documentation that aptly explains the working without requiring to go through the code.” [Raghu Nandan](https://www.quora.com/Software-Engineering/What-is-the-hardest-thing-you-do-as-a-software-engineer/answer/Raghu-Nandan-7)

### 6. Implementing functionality you disagree with
**The task:** Having to implement a feature or functionality that, for whatever reason, you feel shouldn’t be included but that the client, or someone above your pay grade, insists on.

**The challenge:** Putting aside your personal feelings and opinions and spending the time and effort to properly implement (and support) the functionality in question.

### 5. Working with someone else’s code
**The task:** Having to maintain, debug or enhance an application or piece of code that was written by another developer(s).

**The challenge:** Trying to understand how a piece of legacy code works and divine the intentions of the original developer. This is even harder when that developer isn’t around and the code is poorly written, commented or documented.

### 4. Dealing with other people
**The task:** Gather requirements from clients, provide status reports to management, work with testers and confer with other engineers about the project.

**The challenge:** Explaining technical things to non-technical people, having your work impacted by others and disagreeing with QA people or other developers

### 3. Estimating time to complete tasks
**The task:** At the outset of a project, come up with time estimates for the work to be done.

**The challenge:** Guessing how long something that you possibly haven’t done before will take, making estimates based on vague requirements and trying to allot time for dealing with unforeseen problems.

**Quotes:**

“...it is actually impossible to predict task length....” [Jack Menendez](https://www.quora.com/Software-Engineering/What-is-the-hardest-thing-you-do-as-a-software-engineer/answer/Jack-Menendez)

### 2. Explaining what I do (or don’t do
**The task:** Convey to non-programmers (family members, friends, non-tech coworkers) what your job entails - and also what it doesn’t.

**The challenge:** Having your loved ones not understand what you do for a living. Being constantly asked to solve any and all computer-related problems.

**Quotes:**

### 1. Naming things
**The task:** Coming up with names for variables, procedures, functions, classes, objects, database components, etc.

**The challenge:*8 Even a small program or application can require the naming of many things. Choosing names that convey what the thing is or does, consistently across the application and concise.

**Quotes:**

# WHAT IS AN OBJECT?

**JavaScript Objects**

A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.

JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.

JavaScript is template based not class based. Here, we don't create class to get the object. But, we direct create objects.

### Creating Objects in JavaScript

**There are 3 ways to create objects.**

* By object literal
*  creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
* By using an object constructor (using new keyword)

### 1) JavaScript Object by object literal

The syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:

**object={property1:value1,property2:value2.....propertyN:valueN} **

As you can see, property and value is separated by : (colon).



Let’s see the simple example of creating object in JavaScript.

< script >  
emp={id:102,name:"Shyam Kumar",salary:40000}  
document.write(emp.id+" "+emp.name+" "+emp.salary);  
< /script >  

### 2) By creating instance of Object

**The syntax of creating object directly is given below:**

var objectname=new Object();  
Here, new keyword is used to create object.

Let’s see the example of creating object directly.

< script >  
var emp=new Object();  
emp.id=101;  
emp.name="Ravi Malik";  
emp.salary=50000;  
document.write(emp.id+" "+emp.name+" "+emp.salary);  
< /script >  

### 3) By using an Object constructor

Here, you need to create function with arguments. Each argument value can be assigned in the current object by using this keyword.


The this keyword refers to the current object.


**The example of creating object by object constructor is given below.**

< script >  
function emp(id,name,salary){  
this.id=id;  
this.name=name;  
this.salary=salary;  
}  
e=new emp(103,"Vimal Jaiswal",30000);  
  
document.write(e.id+" "+e.name+" "+e.salary);  
< /script >  

# Document Object Model

### JavaScript HTML DOM

With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

**The HTML DOM (Document Object Model)**

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

* The HTML DOM Tree of Objects
* DOM HTML tree
* With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

1. JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page 

2. JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page

3. JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page

4. JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes

5. JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes

6. JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page

7. JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

### What is the HTML DOM?

The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

1. The HTML elements as objects
2. The properties of all HTML elements
3. The methods to access all HTML elements
4. The events for all HTML elements

**In other words:** The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

**DOM TREE:**

### WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE
Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:

1: Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.

2: Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 

#### STEP 1: ACCESS THE ELEMENTS

**SELECT AN INDIVIDUAL ELEMENT NODE **

![select an individual element node](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbstractRange/simpledom.svg)


##### How to select 1 element on the page with JavaScript

To select one single element on a HTML page you need the document.querySelector()! Just put a condition as a parameter and the DOM will be searched for the element.

**For example**, we want to find the header with a class “header__main”.

document.querySelector('.header__main')

The document.querySelector is gonna returns the first element on the page that matches the selector.

The element is a NodeList Object. You can find a lot of information of your element in this Object. For example: style, height, width, classnames, data-attributes, child elements and a whole lot more!
