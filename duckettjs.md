# JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY

## Introduction:

### EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT

**IN THE BROWSER**

Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in
the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to:

**Access** the content of the page

**Modify** the content of the page

**Program** rules or instructions the browser can follow

**React** to events triggered by the user or browser

#### SLIDESHOWS


Slideshows can display a number of different images (or other HTML content) within the same space on a given page.

 They can play automatically as
a sequence, or users can click through the slides manually.

 They allow more content to be displayed
within a limited amount of space.

**React**: Script triggered when the page loads

**Access**: Get each slide from the slideshow

**Modify:** Only show the first slide (hide others)

**Program:** Set a timer: when to show next slide

**Modify:** Change which slide is shown

**React:** When user clicks button for different slide

**Program:** Determine which slide to show

**Modify:** Show the requested slide

#### FORMS


Validating forms (checking whether they have been

filled in correctly) is important when information is supplied by users. 

JavaScript lets you alert the user
if mistakes have been made. 

It can also perform sophisticated calculations based on any data entered
and reveal the results to the user.

**React:** User presses the submit button when they have entered their name

**Access:** Get value from form field

**Program:** Check that the name is long enough

**Modify:** Show a warning message if the name is not long enough 

## what is a Script and how do i create one?

#### A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS

A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.
You could compare scripts to any of the following: 

**RECIPES**

**HANDBOOKS**

**MANUALS**

#### WRITING A SCRIPT
To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.

Humans can achieve complex goals without thinking about them too much, for example you might be able to drive a car, cook breakfast, or send an email without a set of detailed instructions. But the first
time we do these things they can seem daunting.

Therefore, when learning a new skill, we often break it down into smaller tasks, and learn one of these at a time. With experience these individual tasks grow
familiar and seem simpler.

Some of the scripts you will be reading or writing when you have finished this book will be quite complicated and might look intimidating at first.

However, a script is just a series of short
instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem in hand. This is why creating a script is like writing a recipe or manual that allows a
computer to solve a puzzle one step at a time.

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.


**1: DEFINE THE GOAL**

First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.

**2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT**

To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.
You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task (and any information it needs to perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it can follow.

**3: CODE EACH STEP**

Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

#### FROM STEPS TO CODE
Every step for every task shown
in a flowchart needs to be written
in a language the computer can
understand and follow.

In this book, we are focussing on the JavaScript language and how it is used in web browsers.

Just like learning any new language, you need to get to grips with the:

• **Vocabulary:** The words that computers
understand

• **Syntax**: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow .
